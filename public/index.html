        <h1> <span id="title">BLGI: the Brandeis Learning Games Initiative</span></h1>
		<p>
			The goal of this initiative is to create web-based games that are 
			designed to help us study how humans learn in a digital environment.
			Our first game, FishPolice!, is a simple 2D fast-reaction game designed 
			to study the interaction between visual and auditory processing in the brain.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the FishPolice! game, your job will be to rapidly classify good 
			from bad based on either visual or auditory stimulus. We will be studying 
			the interaction between the visual and the auditory processing systems 
			in the brain and you will get to see how your performance compares 
			to everyone else in the study after each game!
		</p>
		<p>
			The FishPolice! has several levels and each level lasts 3 minutes. 
			Your goal is to correctly classify as many fish as you can!
		</p>
		<p> There are two modes: Visual and Auditory. 
			In both cases, the fish will oscillate in two modes, fast and slow. 
			The fast fish are bad and the slow fish are good.  
			You should press "P" for the good fish to "Process" them 
			and "L" for the bad fish to "Leave" them alone. 
			In Visual mode you should only pay attention to the visual appearance of the fish 
			and in Auditory mode you should only pay attention to the sound of the fish.
			</p
			<p>
				One complication is that you will sometimes experience oddball fish. 
				Most fish have both a visual and an auditory presence. 
				The oddball fish are either invisible or silent and when an oddball fish is present, 
				you need to press the "O" key! 
				The main reason for oddballs is to make sure that 
				you don't turn down your sound in the Visual mode 
				or look away from the screen in Auditory mode!

						<h1>Rules</h1>
						<ul><li>
							The good fish are those that oscillate slowly, the bad fish oscillate quickly.
						</li><li>
							In VISUAL mode you use the visual oscillation speed to determine if fish are good or bad.
						</li><li>
							In AURAL mode, you use the audio oscillation to determine the goodness/badness of fish
						</li><li>
							Press "P" for good fish, and "L" for bad fish.
						</li><li>
							BUT if a fish has no audio or no video it is an oddball and you should press the "O" key.
						</li></ul>
